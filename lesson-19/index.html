                            Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs
                            personality test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality
                            types. Our template integrates questions from this online personality test example into a
                            series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out
                            the Myers Briggs basics article.

                        <p>In the beginning, It’s just about brainstorming.</p>
                        <p>
                            I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m working on (and find
                            the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things
                            responsively. Most of the time perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.

                        <p>I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to each screen.
                            For each of those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are
                            in that particular flow and jump around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made
                            wireframe.

                React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the
                app platform‚Äôs
                native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access ysour platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
                describe the appearance
                and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more
                about React in the next section.
                But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                <sup>3</sup>React Fundamentals

                    React,
                </span>
                a popular open source library for
                building user interfaces with JavaScript.
                To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started
                or can serve as a refresher course.
            </span>
            <span class="text">
                We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </span>
            <span class="text">
                <span class="bold__text">
                    + components.
                </span>
                The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                examples: friendly,
                approachable
                creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </span>
            <span class="text">
                <span class="bold__text">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                elements inside JavaScript like so:
                <span class="selected__text">
                    &lsaquo;Text&rsaquo;Hello, I am your cat! &lsaquo;/Text&rsaquo;.
                </span>
                The React docs have
                <span class="underline__text">
                    a comprehensiveguide to JSX
                </span>
                you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you
                are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
                <span class="selected__text">
                    &lsaquo;Text&rsaquo;.
                </span>
            </span>
            <span class="text">
                <span class="bold__text"> + props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </span>
            <span class="text">
                <span class="bold__text">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                how components render, state
                is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

                <sup>4</sup>Handling Text Input
            </span>
            <span class="text">
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes
                a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function
                to be called when the text is submitted.
            </span>
            <span class="text">
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.
                In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"
                would be translated as "üçï üçï".
